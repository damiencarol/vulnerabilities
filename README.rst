* Load reports from different tools (Anchore Grype, Bandit, CycloneDX format)

Quick example
=============
Here's a snapshot, just to give an idea about the power of the
package. For more examples, look at the documentation.

Suppose you want to read data from Bandit in pandas.
here is the code:

    >>> from vulnerabilities.tools.bandit.parser import BanditParser
    >>> findings = BanditParser().get_findings(open("tests/scans/bandit/report1.json"), None)
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(findings)
    >>> df.loc[:,['title','severity','file_path','line']]
                                                   title severity                  file_path  line

All parsers will produce the same data structure with the same attributes.
